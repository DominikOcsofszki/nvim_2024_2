*g:vimtex_toc_config*
  This is a dictionary that can be used to configure the ToC. Each key
  specifies a configuration option that can be changed. For configuration of
  specific matchers, see |g:vimtex_toc_config_matchers|.

  In the following, the possible configuration keys are explained briefly and
  the default values are indicated.

    `name` : `Table of contents (VimTeX)`
      The name of the ToC buffer.

    `mode` : 1
      The ToC display mode, one of:
      1: Separate window.
      2: Separate window and location list.
      3: Location list (and don't open it).
      4: Location list (and open it).

    `fold_enable` : 0
      Whether to enable folding in the ToC window.

    `fold_level_start` : -1
      The starting fold level. The value -1 indicates that the start level is
      the same as the `tocdepth` value.

    `hide_line_numbers` : 1
      If enabled, then line numbers will be hidden in the ToC window by
      setting |nonumber| and |norelativenumber| locally.

    `hotkeys_enabled` : 0
      Set to 1 to enable individual hotkeys for ToC entries.

    `hotkeys` : `abcdegijklmnopuvxyz`
      A string of keys that are used to create individual hotkeys.

    `hotkeys_leader` : `;`
      The hotkey leader. Set to empty string to disable the leader.

    `indent_levels` : 0
      Set to 1 to indent the section levels in the ToC window.

    `layers` : Undefined
    `layer_status` : Dictionary >
        { 'content': 1,
          'label': 1,
          'todo': 1,
          'include': 1 }
<      The initial state of the layers (1 for active, 0 for inactive). The
      `layers` key may be used as a shorthand: it accepts a list of layers
      that should be active.

    `layer_keys` : Dictionary >
        { 'content': 'C',
          'label': 'L',
          'todo': 'T',
          'include': 'I'}
<      Specify hotkeys for enabling/disabling the different layers.

    `resize` : 0
      Whether or not to automatically resize vim when index windows are
      opened.

      Note: This option makes sense if the index window is vertically split.

    `refresh_always` : 1
      Set to 0 to manually refresh ToC entries. This may be useful for very
      large projects where generating the ToC entries becomes slow.

      It may be useful to combine manually refreshing with a |BufWritePost|
      autocommand, e.g.: >vim

        augroup VimTeX
          autocmd!
          autocmd BufWritePost *.tex call vimtex#toc#refresh()
        augroup END
<
      Or, if preferred, one may use a mapping such as: >vim

        nnoremap <silent> <localleader>lf :call vimtex#toc#refresh()
<
    `show_help` : 1
      Whether to display help text on top when the ToC is opened. If this is
      disabled, we only show "Press h to toggle help text.".

    `show_numbers` : 1
      Set whether or not to show section numbers in ToC.

    `split_pos` : `vert leftabove`
      Define where index windows should be opened. This is a string that
      contains either the word "full" to open in the current window, or
      a position command. Use |:vert| if a vertical split is desired, and one
      of |:leftabove|, |:rightbelow|, |:topleft|, and |:botright| to specify
      the desired split position.

    `split_width` : 30
      For vertically split windows: Set width of index window.

    `tocdepth` : 3
      Define the depth of section levels to display. This attempts to mimic
      the corresponding latex variable `tocdepth`. For more info, see:
      https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Document_Structure

      Note: This will also change the width of the number column according to
            the space needed to show the section numbers.

    `todo_sorted` : 1
      Whether or not to sort the TODOs at the top of the ToC window.
